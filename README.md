In this scenario, you're consulting for a high-visibility online consumer products review site.

You've been asked to provide data-backed analysis and recommendations around vehicle fuel economy. Your client is especially interested in being able to offer advice around vehicle types, manufacturers, and technical specs. They want to understand how those might drive fuel economy and annual fuel costs.

The raw fuel costs data is available here. Note that this data originally comes from Kaggle. For a further description of the variables, see FuelEconomy.gov.
